                <p>This Python code game is an online version of
                    Battleship that a partner and I wrote from scratch as 
                    our final project for our Intro to Software Development
                    class. As we worked, we continued to develop the game 
                    idea and learn new things to make the game how we envisioned
                    it. Although there is no way to link to the code, the link 
                    above is the proposal submitted by my team.

                <p>For this project, a partner and I were given
                    a game to develop and given free reign on how to implement
                    all of the features our "client" requested. We created this 
                    game in a series of sprints in which we were continually given
                    new benchmarks for development and changes to impement according
                    to the client's specificiations. The link above is the final 
                    presentation PowerPoint created by myself and my partner.

                <p>All of the seven labs in ECE233 built to creating a version of
                    Guitar Hero playable on an FPGA board. While a small amount of 
                    the final project circuit was given to us based on it being outside
                    the class's scope, it was up to myself and my partner to make circuits
                    throughout the quarter for which we needed to design logic and test 
                    to ensure logic accuracy. The link above is my final lab report for 
                    the working Guitar Hero game.
