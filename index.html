        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a sophomore at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology width
            a major in computer science. Our slogan may be "Fear the Engineer", but I 
            believe attending this school has increased my skills in effective team 
            communication and leadership. Professionally, I am interested in web development
            opportunities and potentially programming related to robotics. I enjoy working
            both alone and with teams and can stay organized and efficient in both environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of school and professional opportunities, I enjoy getting out and being an 
            active member of my school community, doing things with my friends, reading (currenty 
            the Witcher series), video games, and comic books! I have two very active kittens back 
            at home and my favorite thing to get out and do is go to the movies. 
            I would love to hear from you! Contact me at my email address below.
